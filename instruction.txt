Task 2 - Connect to the Linux terminal using a Secure SHell (SSH)

To set a user password you need to access the HDP host. This is achieved through
Secure SHell (SSH). Locate and run a program on your system called PuTTY, this
is a SSH client.
When PuTTY loads, enter sandbox.hortonworks.com as the host name and set the
target port to 2222. On connection, you will be presented with a security
alert, this is because you have never connected to this Server before and PuTTY
has no record of its key fingerprint. Click yes to add this to your fingerprint
record.

When you connect you will be asked to login, provide the username root and the
password hadoop.
After this you will be asked to confirm you current password then supply and
confirm a new password. This new password will be your linux password for the
root user, take note of it.
After you set this password you will be logged into the HDP host.
